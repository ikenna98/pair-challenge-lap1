### Our pair project.

- cd into the server folder
- Use `npm install` to get dependencies
- Use `npm run dev` to start the server
- Open index.html in the client folder to view in the browser
- The search bar can be used to search for any Western Conference NBA team e.g. Lakers, Rockets
- It's design so that a specific word about the team will open the right result, e.g.:
    - If you wanted to search for the Golden State Warriors you could type 'golden', 'state' or 'warriors' and the same result will still show, case insensitive.
- When you click search it will open the team's website
- If the search bar is left empty when searching it will show the array of objects in our API
- The 'im feeling lucky' button will open the website of any team in our API randomly
